# predicting-molecular-properties
This project aims to develop a solution to the Predicting Molecular Properties Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/overview)

## Environment
The development code for this project is implemented on an iPython Notebook based in the Google Colaboratory environment. 

## Data
Datasets for this project are provided by Kaggle and can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/data

Alternatively, the data can also be downloaded using the Kaggle API:

`!kaggle competitions download -c champs-scalar-coupling`

## Libraries
The libraries used in this project are: 

1.  NumPy: a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, broadcasting functions, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform and random number capabilities.
2. Pandas: an open source library providing high-performance, user-friendly data structures and data analysis tools.
3. Matplotlib: a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments. Plots, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots etc can be generated using Matplotlib.
4. Seaborn: a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
5. Scikit Learn: contains simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, and is built on NumPy, SciPy and MatplotLib
6. Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
